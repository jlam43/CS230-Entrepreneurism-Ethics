## A. Core Values
The core values of Gaia Industries are based around sustainability, innovation, transparency, and inclusivity. Gaia Industries' goal is to be considered as one of the leaders in green technology, by transforming the construction industry with both ethical and eco-friendly solutions. The foundation of our company is sustainability, and with this in mind, we're driven to reduce carbon emmissions and turn waste back into useful materials. All of our business practices follow the theme of transparency, from data handling to environmental impact assesments, everything will be openly accessible to our stakeholders. Our community outreach is guided by inclusivity, ensuring that our sustainable products are available to all communities, not just high income and middle class, we are focused on ensuring coverage in underrepresented and low-income communties.
## B. Motivation
Gaia Industries' motivation comes from our love for our planet and the hope that we will have a sustainable future. We are driven by our goal of reducing the harm we as humans do to our environment, and transforming urban development through solutions that fight climate change. As a company, our biggest fear is what is happening right now, letting environmental harm continue unchecked. We also fear contributing to the inequality in the eco-friendly space that keeps low income communities from having access to environmentally concious resources. We strive to ensure that our products are affordable and accessible to all. These fears challenge us to continue to innovate while working to solve the global climate crisis. By keeping in line with our mission, Gaia Industries hopes to inspire everyone to take action towards making our planet healthier.
