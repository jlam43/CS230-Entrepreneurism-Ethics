A. Company Name 
Gaia Industries is a green tech startup that specializes in creating carbon-capturing building materials made from recycled and organic waste. By transforming waste into sustainable construction materials, Gaia Industries aims to revolutionize the construction industry and significantly reduce its carbon footprint while promoting elimination of waste and pollution. These materials are designed to store carbon and can be used in buildings, infrastructure, and homes.
Our goal for this company is to reduce our overall carbon emission by specializing in creating carbon capturing building materials exclusively made from recycled and organic materials. We aim to transform waste into sustainable construction materials, Gaia Industries goals is to revolutionize the construction industry by significantly reducing its carbon footprint while getting rid of waste and pollution. Our materials will be designed to store carbon for a very long time and their primary purpose is to be used to build infrastructure and homes. By buying products from Gaia this can help support eco friendly construction companies as well as fight against climate change.

The concept behind Gaia Industries was born from highschool where I took AP Environmental Science. The class was an eye opening experience. It taught me how our environment is abused and exploited everyday with no fear of repercussion. During my time in environmental science me and my classmates had done a project where we would provide bikes for students to use instead of a car. Our goal was to reduce individual carbon footprint by using less fossil fuels. 
Gaia Industries aims to revolutionize the construction industry by integrating sustainable building materials that actively capture and store carbon. By 2040, we strive to have our products incorporated in 20% of homes in the United States, with a focus on eco-friendly housing developments in major cities like New York and San Francisco.
Our mission is to minimize the environmental impact of urban development by providing construction materials that not only reduce carbon emissions but also actively capture and store it. We value sustainability, innovation, and transparency in how we handle environmental data. Our purpose is to contribute to a healthier planet while offering economic benefits to our stakeholders through cutting-edge green technology.

Key Questions
How can we make carbon capture technology accessible to large-scale construction projects?
What ethical considerations arise from storing and managing environmental data?
How can Gaia Industries help reshape urban development while maintaining high ethical standards?

C. Strategy with Ethical Impacts and Ethical Safeguards
C.1: OKRs (Key Milestones/Checkpoints)
OKR 1: Integrate Gaia Industriesâ€™ carbon-capturing materials into 100 construction projects across 3 major U.S. cities by 2026.
Metric: Number of projects using our materials, tracked quarterly.
OKR 2: Achieve 90% accuracy in tracking carbon captured by Gaia materials.
Metric: Accuracy rate determined by the data collected from cloud-based systems and on-site sensors.
OKR 3: Achieve 80% user satisfaction based on a survey of homebuyers and renters living in buildings constructed with Gaia materials.
Metric: Customer satisfaction score from post-construction surveys.

C.2: Metrics for Success
OKR 1 Metric: Success will be measured by tracking how many construction projects adopt our technology, using quarterly reports from our sales and construction teams. This will be evaluated based on contracts signed, material delivered, and the project's completion.
OKR 2 Metric: Accuracy of carbon data will be measured using automated reports generated from cloud storage systems. Success is defined as at least 90% accuracy in carbon tracking compared to pre-construction estimates.
OKR 3 Metric: User satisfaction will be evaluated using surveys distributed to homeowners and tenants, measured on a 1-100% scale. Success is defined as an average score of 80% or higher.

C.3: Ethical Impacts/Issues
OKR 1 Ethical Issue: Expanding into multiple cities raises the ethical issue of environmental justice. There is a risk that eco-friendly housing could become a privilege for wealthier areas, excluding low-income communities.
OKR 2 Ethical Issue: The collection and storage of environmental data raise privacy concerns. If carbon capture data is accessed by unauthorized third parties, it could be misused for profit-driven purposes or influence political decisions that might affect funding for environmental initiatives.
OKR 3 Ethical Issue: The satisfaction survey could face bias, as respondents who can afford eco-friendly homes may not reflect the wider population, which could skew the perceived success of the product.

C.4: Ethical Safeguards
OKR 1 Safeguard: Gaia Industries will partner with non-profits and government initiatives focused on affordable housing to ensure that our products are accessible to low-income communities as well. Additionally, we will implement a sliding scale pricing model for environmentally friendly projects in underprivileged areas.
OKR 2 Safeguard: We will employ AES-256 encryption and multi-factor authentication for all data storage, ensuring that carbon capture data is secure. Access to this data will be restricted to authorized personnel only, and we will adhere to compliance regulations like GDPR and CCPA to safeguard customer privacy.
OKR 3 Safeguard: To avoid survey bias, we will collect feedback from a diverse group of homeowners and renters, ensuring representation from different economic backgrounds, locations, and experiences. We will also use random sampling to reduce selection bias.
